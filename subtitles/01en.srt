1
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:54,710
Better head to work.

2
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,120
It's about 60,000 a month 
for cutting down trees, right?

3
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:25,250
Then there's the kidney I sold. 
That was 1.2 million.

4
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:29,480
My right eye was 300,000.

5
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:32,370
Sold one of my nuts...

6
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:37,220
How much was that, again? 
I think... not even 100,000.

7
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:42,870
And I still owe...

8
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,870
About 38,040,000 yen.

9
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,050
I heard you, Pochita.

10
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:54,850
Let's kill this thing already.

11
00:01:55,880 --> 00:02:00,720
A dead devil's usually good 
for about 300,000...

12
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,420
Devil hunting pays the best, easy.

13
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:54,950
Gotta be the Tomato Devil.

14
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:58,350
He'll revive from the seeds, 
so you'll wanna burn those.

15
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:01,000
Nice work, Denji.

16
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,450
This carcass will bring in a fair 
price on the black market.

17
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:07,410
I'll pay you 400,000.

18
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:08,350
Hey, thanks!

19
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:11,590
After what you owe and 
the interest, that leaves 170,000.

20
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:14,710
So after the finder's fee, admin fee,

21
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:19,149
management costs, and so on...

22
00:04:19,769 --> 00:04:21,649
Leaves me with 70,000.

23
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:28,460
After the water bill, 
and some other stuff I owe...

24
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:30,910
Funny how that works.

25
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:34,410
I've got 1,800 yen left.

26
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:40,600
No food at home, and this is gonna 
have to last us a month, so...

27
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:45,160
Pochita, looks like dinner's 
gonna be a slice of bread.

28
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:55,060
Why hire a brat like that to hunt devils?

29
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:59,130
He's paying off what he owes us.

30
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:02,940
Well, technically, it was 
his deadbeat old man's debt.

31
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:07,320
And a kid with a pet devil 
can get the job done?

32
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:10,480
The thing about real devil hunters is...

33
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:14,830
They don't pass devil 
carcasses onto the yakuza.

34
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:19,330
Besides, the best thing about Denji 
is he does what he's told.

35
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:26,200
Hey, dog!

36
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:29,970
I'll give you 100 yen to eat this cigarette.

37
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:34,220
For real?

38
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:35,690
Don't mind if I do.

39
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:44,340
We'll be in touch 
when there's another devil.

40
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:46,860
Try and run, and you're pig slop.

41
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:04,980
That'll keep us for another three days.

42
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,510
The other day I heard...

43
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:14,190
That normally, people put jam 
on their bread, before eating it.

44
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:18,610
Normal's just a dream for us, though.

45
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:22,770
Doubt I'll pay off this debt before I die.

46
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,930
Probably gonna die without 
ever having a girlfriend, too.

47
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:33,870
Not like I could invite a girl to this dump.

48
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:35,910
No money to go on dates, either.

49
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:43,040
If I could have one dream come true...

50
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,720
I wanna score with a girl before I die.

51
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:05,400
Bastard hung himself <i>without</i> 
paying this month's installment first.

52
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,600
Boy, you've got until tomorrow 
to put 700,000 together.

53
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:12,400
You can beg for it, whore yourself out...
 I don't care. Get it done.

54
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:16,450
Otherwise, we chop you up and sell the bits.

55
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:32,420
A ch-chainsaw...?

56
00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:38,260
A devil.

57
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:44,010
If you're gonna kill me, just do it. 
I'm dead either way.

58
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,110
It's hurt?

59
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,300
You're gonna die, too?

60
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:05,040
Bite me!

61
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:08,920
I heard that drinking blood heals a devil.

62
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:10,990
If you don't wanna die, bite me!

63
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:27,940
My blood's not free, though. This is a deal!

64
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:30,190
I'll help you...

65
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:32,200
So, you help me.

66
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:38,330
Because I don't wanna die, after all.

67
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:55,670
Why don't you hire me as a devil hunter?

68
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,470
Too hungry to sleep.

69
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:08,060
When I can't sleep, 
I start thinking about money,

70
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:09,770
and then it's even harder to sleep.

71
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:15,860
I know what dream I wanna have when I sleep.

72
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,960
Gonna put jam on my bread, 
and share it with you.

73
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:22,480
Then I'm gonna flirt with a girl...

74
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:26,240
I'll play video games with her, and then 
we'll fall asleep hugging each other.

75
00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:28,500
Sounds sweet, right?

76
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:49,970
Y'know, I heard my mom died from some 
heart disease that made her cough up blood.

77
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:56,940
Got a devil for you, Denji. Time for work.

78
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:19,350
<i>Wish they'd at least let me dream...</i>

79
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:47,740
There's a devil in here, huh?

80
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:54,250
I don't see anything.

81
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,530
You think it's hiding?

82
00:10:57,590 --> 00:11:00,610
Or maybe it left already?

83
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:17,520
Denji, my boy... we're pretty 
grateful to you, y'know?

84
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:19,550
Yeah?

85
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:22,100
You're as loyal as a dog,

86
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:25,690
and you work for cheap like one, too.

87
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:30,910
Only problem with dogs 
is I can't stand the stench.

88
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:50,430
Even yakuza think about getting bigger 
and making more money, kid.

89
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:54,740
So we did like you, 
and made a deal with a devil.

90
00:11:57,330 --> 00:12:01,030
We wanted demonic power...

91
00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:04,960
And I want devil hunters...

92
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,540
Dead!

93
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:13,030
Y'know, little devil hunter, 
these guys are dumb as hell.

94
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:14,610
Total suckers!

95
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:21,210
I offer them a bit of demonic power, 
and they offer to become my slaves...

96
00:12:21,210 --> 00:12:24,580
Even though the power 
turns them into zombies.

97
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:27,220
See, because I'm the Zombie Devil.

98
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:31,970
And I hate devil hunters, because you
 go around killing us devils.

99
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:34,490
So I'm gonna kill you.

100
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:41,070
Boys, tear him apart 
and toss him in the trash.

101
00:12:42,090 --> 00:12:43,230
Shit!

102
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:00,130
How do I get out of here?

103
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:18,100
Get off!

104
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:33,530
<i>It's not like I'm asking to be rich.</i>

105
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:38,130
<i>All I want is a normal life!</i>

106
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:42,590
<i>And I can't even have that?!</i>

107
00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:24,080
<i>Pochita...</i>

108
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:25,600
<i>Pochita!</i>

109
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:29,260
Pochita, time for work.

110
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:46,900
Pochita, there's a good chance 
I'm gonna die fighting a devil.

111
00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:50,610
My only regret would be 
leaving you on your own.

112
00:14:51,530 --> 00:14:54,170
You could end up starving to death...

113
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,560
Or some other devil hunter might kill you.

114
00:15:02,090 --> 00:15:06,300
I've heard some devils 
can take over dead bodies.

115
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:12,580
If that's something you can do... 
then I want you to have my body.

116
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:18,060
The yakuza won't be on your case 
if you wait until I've been buried, right?

117
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:23,000
And then you could move 
out of here... and then...

118
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,060
Yeah.

119
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:29,840
I want you to live a normal life, 
and die a normal death.

120
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:36,200
You've gotta make my dream come true.

121
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:05,280
Pochita?

122
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:11,030
Did you take my body, like I said?

123
00:16:13,210 --> 00:16:17,780
I always loved hearing you talk 
about your dreams, Denji.

124
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:23,920
Here's the deal. I'll give you my heart...

125
00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:28,790
And in exchange, I want you 
to show me your dream.

126
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:29,670
Pochita?!

127
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:37,640
I'm not hurt?

128
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:45,810
Pochita...?

129
00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:55,500
What is this?

130
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,770
You're alive after being sliced up?

131
00:16:57,770 --> 00:16:59,580
Why? Gross!

132
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:02,580
I seriously hate devil hunters.

133
00:17:02,890 --> 00:17:05,859
Guys, go ahead and eat him.

134
00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:17,089
<i>These guys had plenty already, 
so why'd they want even more?</i>

135
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:19,599
<i>Am I the same?</i>

136
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:23,599
<i>I wasn't satisfied with 
the happiness I had with Pochita.</i>

137
00:17:24,050 --> 00:17:26,930
<i>I kept dreaming about a better life.</i>

138
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:31,610
<i>I guess we all dream 
about stuff like that, huh?</i>

139
00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:34,740
<i>I can't blame you, then.</i>

140
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:38,360
<i>And I won't, but...</i>

141
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,870
<i>If you get in our way?</i>

142
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:46,930
You'll die!

143
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:58,880
He's bound to stay dead after being eaten.

144
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:32,790
What are you?!

145
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:36,800
Did that devil runt take your body?!

146
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:39,470
That means you're one of us!

147
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:01,890
Ow...

148
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:16,630
It hurts!

149
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:20,400
Stay away!

150
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,430
Move!

151
00:19:26,430 --> 00:19:29,430
Stay back! Back! Get away!

152
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:31,940
Stay away! Don't do it!

153
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:33,940
Don't come near me!

154
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:49,890
Die!

155
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:31,080
I guess you guys went full devil, huh?

156
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,290
Well, you hired me to be a devil hunter.

157
00:20:35,290 --> 00:20:39,550
So, I better kill all the devils, right?!

158
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:46,090
Oh, yeah!

159
00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:49,470
Once you're all dead...

160
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:51,740
I won't owe a damn thing!

161
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:40,440
Someone got here before us.

162
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:51,050
There's still one alive.

163
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:09,250
You've got a strange smell.

164
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:12,600
Not like a human or a devil.

165
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:17,680
I take it you did this?

166
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:24,110
H-Hug me...

167
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:44,670
He's human.

168
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:47,420
Any chance he's possessed?

169
00:22:47,810 --> 00:22:49,120
No.

170
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:51,400
I can tell who's possessed 
with a look at their face.

171
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:57,050
I came here to kill the Zombie Devil.

172
00:22:57,050 --> 00:22:59,300
I'm a devil hunter with Public Safety.

173
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,990
You have two options:

174
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:09,800
I can kill you like a devil,

175
00:23:10,670 --> 00:23:13,290
or I can keep you as a human.

176
00:23:13,950 --> 00:23:17,200
If I keep you, I'll make sure you're fed.

177
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,590
When you say that...

178
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:30,720
Like, what's for breakfast?

179
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:38,100
Bread with butter and jam, salad, coffee...

180
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:42,230
And then maybe something 
for dessert, I think?

181
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:53,580
That sounds awesome.
